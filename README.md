# ox_inventory

This is a fork of the original ox_inventory v2.41.0, with QB support

What I want to implement in this fork:

- [x] Allow opening trunks with primary inventory button

    See line 786 in [client.lua](./client.lua) and [config.cfg](./config.cfg)

- [ ] Better way to add custom items without modifying the original files

    The original way to add new items is modifying files like [data/items.lua](data/items.lua). In my opinion this isn't effective and might cause errors (This script treats the file as plain text when adding new items into it). So I created the [data/custom/](data/custom/) directory and I can just add items into the `.lua` files in there.

    I modified some of the logic to make the script to be able to read these custom files. Here's an example in [modules/items/shared.lua](modules/items/shared.lua):

    ```lua
    -- Read both files and merge them into 1 table
    local oxWeapons = lib.load('data.weapons')
    local customWeapons = lib.load('data.custom.weapons')

    for category, categoryItem in pairs(customWeapons) do
        for name, info in pairs(categoryItem) do
            oxWeapons[category][name] = info
        end
    end

    -- The original logic etc...
    for type, data in pairs(oxWeapons) do
        ...
    end
    ```

    There's more across the script, see this [issue](https://github.com/massdync/ox_inventory/issues/1)

- [ ] Prevent item loss from trying to pick up an item when inventory is full

    (Already implemented by the original creators?)

    I had experience with ox_inventory where I'm allowed to pickup an item via ox_target but the item wasn't actually added to my inventory because it was full, and the item disappeared after that

    I believe this can be done via returning `false` in an event listener (Return `true` to allow the action, `false` to cancel it), see: https://overextended.dev/ox_inventory/Events/Client

- [ ] Prevent item loss from trying to pick up an item when inventory maximum weight is reached

    Same as the one above, I believe this can also be done within the same event listener.

Some of the items above might be finished but need further tests.
